I feel you sometimes
I feel the depths of your soul
But maybe I need to focus more on my own soul
Cause I feel like I could not water the flowers
The flowers from you
But when I realize the fault I made by your side
They will bloom once again
You know love is hard to explain
It's like we’re dancing in the rain
But I'm never gonna give up understanding what
love is
So that I can bring you flowers next time
Shine bright, rain fall,
I want to feel the same
The way you feel it, babe
My sole desire is talking with words afire
Let's water the flowers together
So we can behold the same view
You know love is hard to explain
It's like we’re dancing in the rain
But I'm never gonna give up understanding what
life is
I can see the blooming fields now
